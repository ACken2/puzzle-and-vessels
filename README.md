# Puzzle and Vessels

This is the source code of a Puzzle and Dragon clone written in Unity 5 engine but with slight modification to fit into the theme of vascular and interventional radiology. The biggest difference is that enemy is defeated solely by the number of combos and the player only lose if he/she runs out of round.

Feel free to reuse this source code for whatever you want. However, some images and all soundtracks are copyrighted by GungHo as they are extracted from Puzzle and Dragon. Use with cautions.
